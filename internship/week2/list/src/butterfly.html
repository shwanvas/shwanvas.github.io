        <h3>BUTTERFLY</h3>
    
        
            <p>A butterfly is an insect with wings that are very beautiful and mesmerizing
            We can observe different colors and patterns in the wings. A butterfly generally consists of 6 thin legs along with two antennas
            There are three parts of the body in a butterfly, typically the head, the main body, and the tail.
            The scales, which are arranged in colorful designs unique to each species, are what gives the butterfly its beauty</p>
